Intelligent Remlok HUD VR overlay for Elite Dangerous

A VR overlay that gives real time information about player activities.

The primary focus of this app is to give instant access to mission information allowing you to sort active missions but value, distance and time remaining and give ongoing mission info (such as the number of targets killed) without having to dig into the mission menu.

Going forward I would like this app to give some player dirven narrative to missions by giving more context such as:

 - Generating crimes for assisnation targets to make them feel more real
 - giving player contextual system information based on their actions (e.g. we took down xyz person in this system and managed to trigger a civil war)
 - showing faction information ore readily (e.g. this system is run by an anarchy faction trust no one)

I would also like to take this a step further and use the app to give BGS help allowing players to select factions to work for and what they are trying to achieve (e.g. expansion, station control or even crippling an enemy faction) and use data from 3rd parties and the game to give hints on what actions to take and what effect they've had.

If you want to get involved I'm more than happy to open the project to collaboration areas I'm struggling with are:

 - UI design 
 - Integrating game mechanic logic particularily for the BGS 
 - Time!
